  -d, --difficulty [easy|medium|hard] Difficulty level [default: medium]
  -g, --grade-level TEXT          Target grade level [default: 5th Grade]
  -o, --output PATH               Output PDF file path
  -m, --model TEXT                LLM model to use [default: gpt-3.5-turbo]
  -t, --template TEXT             Prompt template [default: generic]
  --config PATH                   Path to configuration file
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose output
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
